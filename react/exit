    DevTools: Improved "native" component stacks (#18656)
    
    * DevTools console override handles new component stack format
    
    DevTools does not attempt to mimic the default browser console format for its component stacks but it does properly detect the new format for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

    Avoid passing custom stacks to console.error (#18685)
    
    * Detect double stacks in the new format in tests
    
    * Remove unnecessary uses of getStackByFiberInDevAndProd
    
    These all execute in the right execution context already.
    
    * Set the debug fiber around the cases that don't have an execution context
    
    * Remove stack detection in our console log overrides
    
    We never pass custom stacks as part of the args anymore.
    
    * Bonus: Don't append getStackAddendum to invariants
    
    We print component stacks for every error anyway so this is just duplicate
    information.

    Fix incorrect unmounted state update warning (#18617)
    
    * Fix incorrect unmounted state update warning
    
    We detach fibers (which nulls the  field) when we commit a deletion, so any state updates scheduled between that point and when we eventually flush passive effect destroys won't have a way to check if there is a pending passive unmount effect scheduled for its alternate unless we also explicitly track this for both the current and the alternate.
    
    This commit adds a new DEV-only effect type, `PendingPassiveUnmountDev`, to handle this case.

    Make Flow work with your editor (#18664)
    
    We typecheck the reconciler against each one of our host configs.
    `yarn flow dom` checks it against the DOM renderer, `yarn flow native`
    checks it against the native renderer, and so on.
    
    To do this, we generate separate flowconfig files.
    
    Currently, there is no root-level host config, so running Flow
    directly via `flow` CLI doesn't work. You have to use the `yarn flow`
    command and pick a specific renderer.
    
    A drawback of this design, though, is that our Flow setup doesn't work
    with other tooling. Namely, editor integrations.
    
    I think the intent of this was maybe so you don't run Flow against a
    renderer than you intended, see it pass, and wrongly think you fixed
    all the errors. However, since they all run in CI, I don't think this
    is a big deal. In practice, I nearly always run Flow against the same
    renderer (DOM), and I'm guessing that's the most common workflow for
    others, too.
    
    So what I've done in this commit is modify the `yarn flow` command to
    copy the generated `.flowconfig` file into the root directory. The
    editor integration will pick this up and show Flow information for
    whatever was the last renderer you checked.
    
    Everything else about the setup is the same, and all the renderers will
    continue to be checked by CI.

    Fix for #18657 (#18663)
    
    * Failing test for #18657
    
    * Remove incorrect priority check
    
    I think this was just poor factoring on my part in #18411. Honestly it
    doesn't make much sense to me, but my best guess is that I must have
    thought that when `baseTime > currentChildExpirationTime`, the function
    would fall through to the
    `currentChildExpirationTime < renderExpirationTime` branch below.
    
    Really I think just made an oopsie.
    
    Regardless, this logic is galaxy brain√©d. A goal of the Lanes refactor
    I'm working on is to make these types of checks -- is there remaining
    work in this tree? -- a lot easier to think about. Hopefully.
