### 1. import and export default
 As you can see here, to import default export we use
 1. import  Teacher from './teacher';
 And for normal import 
2. import {promote} from './teacher'

so
```sh
import React, {Component} from 'react'
```


```sh
import  Teacher, {promote} from './teacher';
const teacher = new Teacher("Souvik","B.Tech");
teacher.teach();
promote();
```


```sh
export function promote(){
  console.log("This Promotiong");
}

export  default  class Teacher{
    constructor(name,degree){
        this.name = name;
        this.degree = degree;
    }
    teach(){
        console.log("Teach");
    }
}

```
